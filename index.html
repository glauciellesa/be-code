      In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither

      Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s
      perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about
      your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing
      as an issue. Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain.
      Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if
      our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense,
      our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited :
      you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message,
      our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes
      depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much,
      everything’s fake. They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and
      you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the
      divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself
      differently. But the person is the same, you just changed your mind.
      Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world,
      it’s that you passively do it anyway.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
        are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
        The farmer said,
        <span class="farmer">
          “Is it <span class="good">good </span>? Is it
          <span class="bad">bad </span>? I don't know.”
        </span>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and
        in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What
        a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again
        said,
        <span class="farmer"
          >“Is it <span class="good">good </span>? Is it
          <span class="bad">bad </span>? I don't know.”</span
        >
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
        riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
        <span class="neighbor"
          >“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad </span>,”
        </span>
        and the farmer responded,
        <span class="farmer">
          “Is it <span class="good">good </span>? Is it
          <span class="bad">bad </span>? I don't know.” </span
        >The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
        into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again,
        he said, “Is it <span class="good">good </span>? Is it
        <span class="bad">bad </span>? I don't know.” The whole process of
        nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
        impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
        <span class="good">good </span> or <span class="bad">bad </span> —
        because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
        or, you never know what will be the consequences of
        <span class="good">good </span> fortune.

    <p class="conclusion">
      Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are
      <span class="good">good </span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not
      <span class="good">good </span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out
      of it...
