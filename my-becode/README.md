# Glaucielle Celestina de SÃ¡

## Frontend junior developer

Hello :) \
I'm Glaucielle, I'm a Brazilian girls who loves development and challenges, and I've been challenging myself to get out of my comfort zone and learn new things since 2019. I've been passionate about technology since my degree in Linguistics, when I had a lot of contact with the area because of a Linguistics internship I was doing at an IT company, however, I was already graduating and did not want to try a new professions.\
 After 5 years working as a Portuguese language teacher, I had the courage to listen to my heart and decided to move from Brazil to live new experiences and challenged myself to learn everything I wanted and was afraid of. English was the first thing, then I started with programming, but it wasn't easy and I gave up in the first few months. Only in 2022 did I have enough determination to start and never stopped. With each passing day I find myself more passionate about what I do.
