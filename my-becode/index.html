      Hello :) \ I&#39;m Glaucielle, I&#39;m a Brazilian girls who loves
      development and challenges, and I&#39;ve been challenging myself to get
      out of my comfort zone and learn new things since 2019. I&#39;ve been
      passionate about technology since my degree in Linguistics, when I had a
      lot of contact with the area because of a Linguistics internship I was
      doing at an IT company, however, I was already graduating and did not want
      to try a new professions.\ After 5 years working as a Portuguese language
      teacher, I had the courage to listen to my heart and decided to move from
      Brazil to live new experiences and challenged myself to learn everything I
      wanted and was afraid of. English was the first thing, then I started with
      programming, but it wasn&#39;t easy and I gave up in the first few months.
      Only in 2022 did I have enough determination to start and never stopped.
      With each passing day I find myself more passionate about what I do.
